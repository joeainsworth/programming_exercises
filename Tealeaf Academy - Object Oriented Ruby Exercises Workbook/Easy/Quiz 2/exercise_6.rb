# If I have the following class:

class Television
  def self.manufacturer
    # method logic
  end

  def model
    # method logic
  end
end

# Which one of these is a class method (if any) and how do you know?
# The manufacturer method is a class method because it is prefixed with .self
# How would you call a class method?
# You would call a class method by prefixing the method name with the class
# name.
