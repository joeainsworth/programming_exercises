# The designers of the vehicle management system now want to make an
# adjustment for how the range of vehicles is calculated. For the seaborne
# vehicles, due to prevailing ocean currents, they want to add an additional
# 10km of range even if the vehicle is out of fuel.

# Alter the code related to vehicles so that the range for autos and
# motorcycles is still calculated as before, but for catamarans and
# motorboats, the range method will return an additional 10km.
